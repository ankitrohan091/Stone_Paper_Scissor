# Stone_Paper_Scissor
I develop a Stone,Paper and Scissor Game by using unique logic in JAVA language.
This is unique because of it give user 5 chances to win the game.
It also says who is the winner in every 5 turn and then decide the final winner of the match.
It also throws an error, if user write an wrong input.
It takes input in words not number and then compare the strings.
Computer generates every time a random input to compare with user.
If user enter wrong input or turn is draw then the turn is not counted.
